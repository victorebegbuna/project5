Am so glad to have completed this project
This project happens to be the closest to the Original given
This is is giving me the confident to go back to the previous ones that really didnt look close and work more on them.
But something is stil missing in this project which is the responsiveness. I would still come back to work on that, but for now, i would rather like to work more on my HTML and CSS very well.

I learnt quite alot of things while working on this particular project and I hope to learn more as I work further on more projects.

Very very soon, I hope to add Java to it, but for now, let me perfect my HTML and CSS.

Thanks for reading!.
